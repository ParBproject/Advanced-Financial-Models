User Guide & Documentation
===========================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================

This Excel workbook contains three professional financial models demonstrating advanced spreadsheet techniques, scenario analysis, and data visualization capabilities:

1. **Cash Flow Model** - 12-month dynamic projection
2. **Loan Risk Model** - Credit risk assessment and portfolio analysis
3. **Portfolio Allocation Model** - Investment optimization and risk-return analysis

All models follow industry-standard financial modeling best practices including color-coded inputs, professional formatting, and zero formula errors.


COLOR CODING STANDARDS (Industry Best Practice)
==============================================

Throughout all models, the following color conventions are used:

• **BLUE TEXT** = User inputs (modify these to create scenarios)
• **BLACK TEXT** = Formulas and calculations (do not modify)
• **GREEN TEXT** = Links from other sheets within this workbook
• **YELLOW BACKGROUND** = Key assumptions requiring attention


MODEL 1: CASH FLOW MODEL
=========================

Sheet: "Cash Flow Model"

PURPOSE
-------
Forecast monthly cash position for a hypothetical company over 12 months, highlighting potential cash shortages and surplus positions.

KEY FEATURES
-----------
✓ Monthly revenue projections with compounding growth
✓ Operating expense tracking (60% of revenue by default)
✓ Detailed expense breakdown: Salaries, Rent, Marketing
✓ Loan repayment schedule
✓ Capital expenditure planning (CapEx)
✓ Conditional formatting: Red highlights cash shortages, green shows healthy balances
✓ Dynamic line chart showing ending cash balance trend
✓ NPV calculation of future cash flows
✓ Key portfolio metrics

HOW TO USE
----------
1. **Modify Input Assumptions** (Blue cells in rows 5-10):
   - Starting Cash Balance ($50,000 default)
   - Monthly Revenue Month 1 ($100,000 default)
   - Revenue Growth Rate (5% default) ⚠️ KEY DRIVER
   - Operating Expense % (60% default)
   - Monthly Loan Payment ($5,000 default)
   - Discount Rate for NPV (10% default) ⚠️ KEY ASSUMPTION

2. **Adjust Specific Items**:
   - Rent: Set in row 23 (currently $8,000/month)
   - Capital Expenditures: Modify blue cells in row 25 (currently in months 2, 5, 9)

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Watch the "Ending Cash Balance" row for potential shortfalls
   - Red cells indicate negative cash (requires financing)
   - Green cells show strong cash position (>$20,000)
   - Review the chart for visual trend analysis

KEY METRICS EXPLAINED
--------------------
• **NPV of Cash Flows**: Present value of future cash flows discounted at 10%
• **Average Monthly Net Cash Flow**: Mean of monthly cash flow changes
• **Minimum Cash Balance**: Lowest cash point (watch for negative)
• **Maximum Cash Balance**: Peak cash position

SCENARIO TESTING IDEAS
---------------------
→ What if revenue grows at 3% instead of 5%? (Change cell B7)
→ What if we delay CapEx investments? (Modify cells in row 25)
→ What if loan payments increase to $7,000/month? (Change cell B9)
→ What if operating expenses rise to 70% of revenue? (Change cell B8)

KEY INSIGHTS FROM BASE SCENARIO
-------------------------------
With 5% monthly revenue growth:
- Starting position: $50,000
- Revenue grows from $100,000 to ~$163,000 by month 12
- Operating expenses consume 60% of revenue
- Three major CapEx investments ($15,000 each)
- Monthly loan payment: $5,000
- Expected outcome: Positive cash position throughout if assumptions hold


MODEL 2: LOAN RISK MODEL
=========================

Sheet: "Loan Risk Model"

PURPOSE
-------
Assess credit risk across a portfolio of 50 loans, calculate expected losses, and identify high-risk exposures requiring attention.

KEY FEATURES
-----------
✓ 50 sample loans with varying credit profiles
✓ Credit score-based risk categorization (300-850 scale)
✓ Probability of Default (PD) calculation based on credit score ranges
✓ Loss Given Default (LGD) assumption (adjustable)
✓ Expected Loss (EL) = Exposure × PD × LGD
✓ Risk rating system: Low / Medium / High
✓ Portfolio summary dashboard
✓ Visual risk distribution chart

HOW TO USE
----------
1. **Review Risk Parameters** (Blue cells in rows 5-6):
   - Loss Given Default (LGD): 45% ⚠️ KEY ASSUMPTION
   - Risk-Free Rate: 3%

2. **Examine Credit Score to Default Rate Mapping** (Section D4:F13):
   - 800-850 → 1% default rate (Low risk)
   - 750-799 → 2% default rate (Low risk)
   - 700-749 → 4% default rate (Low risk)
   - 650-699 → 8% default rate (Medium risk)
   - 600-649 → 15% default rate (Medium risk)
   - 550-599 → 25% default rate (High risk)
   - 500-549 → 35% default rate (High risk)
   - <500 → 50% default rate (High risk)

3. **Analyze Loan Portfolio** (Rows 17-66):
   - Each loan shows: ID, Borrower, Amount, Credit Score
   - Calculated: Default Rate, LGD, Exposure, Expected Loss, Risk Rating
   - Blue cells (Loan Amount, Credit Score) can be modified for what-if analysis

4. **Review Portfolio Summary** (Bottom section):
   - Total number of loans
   - Total exposure at default
   - Total expected loss
   - Expected loss as % of portfolio
   - Risk distribution (High/Medium/Low counts)
   - Average credit score

UNDERSTANDING THE CALCULATIONS
-----------------------------
**Probability of Default (PD)**: Likelihood that a borrower will default, based on credit score
**Loss Given Default (LGD)**: Percentage of loan amount lost if default occurs (45% assumption)
**Exposure at Default (EAD)**: Outstanding loan amount at time of default
**Expected Loss (EL)**: EAD × PD × LGD (the amount we expect to lose statistically)

Example Calculation:
- Loan Amount: $100,000
- Credit Score: 620 → Default Rate = 15%
- LGD = 45%
- Expected Loss = $100,000 × 15% × 45% = $6,750

SCENARIO TESTING IDEAS
---------------------
→ What if LGD increases to 55% in a recession? (Change cell B5)
→ What if we tighten credit standards and reject loans with scores <650?
→ What is the expected loss for only high-risk loans? (Filter by risk rating)
→ Which borrowers contribute most to portfolio risk? (Sort by Expected Loss)

KEY INSIGHTS FROM SAMPLE PORTFOLIO
---------------------------------
- 50 loans in portfolio
- Total exposure varies by loan size (typically $10K-$500K)
- Credit scores range from 450-850
- Risk distribution shows concentration of high/medium/low risks
- Expected loss percentage indicates overall portfolio health
- High-risk loans (PD ≥ 20%) require enhanced monitoring

ADVANCED ANALYSIS SUGGESTIONS
----------------------------
• Create a Pivot Table to analyze expected loss by risk rating
• Use Data Tables for sensitivity analysis on LGD assumptions
• Apply filters to identify loans requiring immediate attention
• Calculate concentration risk by borrower or credit score bands


MODEL 3: PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION MODEL
====================================

Sheet: "Portfolio Allocation"

PURPOSE
-------
Optimize investment portfolio allocation across six asset classes to balance risk and return based on investor objectives.

KEY FEATURES
-----------
✓ 6 asset classes with historical return and volatility data
✓ Dynamic allocation percentages (must sum to 100%)
✓ Expected return calculation (weighted average)
✓ Portfolio risk calculation (weighted standard deviation)
✓ Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted performance
✓ 10-year projected portfolio value
✓ Three preset scenarios: Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive
✓ Visual pie chart showing allocation
✓ Scenario comparison bar chart

HOW TO USE
----------
1. **Set Portfolio Parameters** (Blue cells in rows 5-7):
   - Total Investment Amount ($1,000,000 default)
   - Risk-Free Rate (3% default)
   - Investment Horizon (10 years default)

2. **Review Asset Classes** (Rows 11-16):
   Each asset class shows:
   - Expected Return (historical 20-year average)
   - Risk/Standard Deviation (volatility)
   - Current Allocation % ⚠️ MODIFY THESE FOR CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS
   - Investment Amount (calculated)
   - Expected Return $ (calculated)

   Asset Classes:
   • Large Cap Stocks: 10% return, 15% risk, 35% allocation
   • Small Cap Stocks: 12% return, 20% risk, 15% allocation
   • International Stocks: 9% return, 17% risk, 15% allocation
   • Bonds: 5% return, 6% risk, 25% allocation
   • Real Estate: 8% return, 14% risk, 7% allocation
   • Commodities: 6% return, 18% risk, 3% allocation

3. **Analyze Portfolio Metrics** (Rows 20-24):
   - Portfolio Expected Return: Weighted average return
   - Portfolio Risk: Weighted standard deviation (simplified model)
   - Sharpe Ratio: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Risk
   - Expected Portfolio Value (10Y): Future value projection
   - Expected Total Return (10Y): Absolute dollar gain

4. **Compare Scenarios** (Rows 27-30):
   Three preset portfolios for comparison:
   - **Conservative**: 50% Bonds, 20% Large Cap, heavy fixed income
   - **Balanced**: 30% Bonds, 30% Large Cap, 15% Small Cap, diversified
   - **Aggressive**: 45% Large Cap, 25% Small Cap, 20% International, growth-focused

UNDERSTANDING THE METRICS
-------------------------
**Expected Return**: Probability-weighted average return = Σ(Allocation% × Asset Return)

**Portfolio Risk**: Simplified volatility = √Σ(Allocation%² × Asset Risk²)
Note: Real portfolios require covariance matrix for correlation effects

**Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Risk
- Higher is better (more return per unit of risk)
- Sharpe > 1.0 is generally considered good
- Sharpe > 2.0 is excellent

**10-Year Projection**: Future Value = Initial Investment × (1 + Annual Return)^10

SCENARIO TESTING IDEAS
---------------------
→ What allocation maximizes Sharpe Ratio? (Use Excel Solver)
→ What if I want <10% portfolio risk? (Adjust allocations)
→ How much in bonds for retirement focus? (Increase bond allocation)
→ What if stock returns drop to 7%? (Change returns in rows 11-13)

USING EXCEL SOLVER FOR OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------------
To find optimal allocation:
1. Go to Data → Solver (enable if not visible in Add-ins)
2. Set Objective: Cell B20 (Portfolio Expected Return)
3. To: Max
4. By Changing: D11:D16 (Allocation percentages)
5. Constraints:
   - D17 = 1 (allocations sum to 100%)
   - D11:D16 >= 0 (no negative allocations)
   - D11:D16 <= 1 (no allocation exceeds 100%)
6. Optional: Add constraint B21 <= 0.12 (limit risk to 12%)
7. Click Solve

KEY INSIGHTS FROM BASE ALLOCATION
--------------------------------
Current "Balanced" approach:
- 35% Large Cap (core equity position)
- 25% Bonds (stability and income)
- 15% Small Cap + 15% International (growth and diversification)
- 10% Alternative investments (Real Estate + Commodities)

Expected outcomes:
- Portfolio Return: ~8.5% annually
- Portfolio Risk: ~11% standard deviation
- Sharpe Ratio: ~0.50 (moderate risk-adjusted return)
- 10-Year Value: ~$2.27 million (on $1M investment)

RISK CONSIDERATIONS
------------------
⚠️ This model uses simplified risk calculation
⚠️ Real portfolios need correlation/covariance analysis
⚠️ Historical returns don't guarantee future performance
⚠️ Tax implications not considered
⚠️ Transaction costs and rebalancing fees excluded

BEST PRACTICES FOR FINANCIAL MODELING
=====================================

When creating or modifying these models, follow these principles:

1. **COLOR CODE EVERYTHING**
   - Blue = Inputs (users should change these)
   - Black = Formulas (protected in production)
   - Green = Links (from other sheets)
   - Red = External links (from other files)
   - Yellow highlight = Key assumptions

2. **ZERO HARDCODED VALUES IN FORMULAS**
   - Always reference cells: =B5*(1+$B$6) not =B5*1.05
   - Put all assumptions in visible, labeled cells
   - Makes scenario analysis possible

3. **PROFESSIONAL NUMBER FORMATTING**
   - Currency: $#,##0 with units in headers "($ thousands)"
   - Zeros display as "-" for cleaner appearance
   - Percentages: One decimal place (0.0%)
   - Negative numbers: Use parentheses (1,234) not -1,234

4. **DOCUMENTATION IS CRITICAL**
   - Label every assumption
   - Add notes for complex formulas
   - Include data sources and dates
   - Create user guide (like this document!)

5. **TEST WITH EXTREME VALUES**
   - What if revenue is $0?
   - What if growth is 100%?
   - Does IRR work with all negative flows?
   - Models should handle edge cases gracefully

6. **BUILD FOR FLEXIBILITY**
   - Use scenario analysis capabilities
   - Make key drivers easily changeable
   - Allow for sensitivity analysis
   - Consider Solver optimization


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Common Issues and Solutions
--------------------------

**Issue**: #DIV/0! error appears
**Solution**: Check for division by zero in formulas. Add IF statement: =IF(B10=0,0,B5/B10)

**Issue**: Circular reference warning
**Solution**: Review formulas - no cell should reference itself directly or indirectly

**Issue**: Portfolio allocations don't sum to 100%
**Solution**: Check cell D17 in Portfolio sheet. Adjust allocations manually or use Solver

**Issue**: Cash flow shows negative beginning cash
**Solution**: Increase starting cash (B5) or reduce early expenses

**Issue**: Expected loss seems too high
**Solution**: Review LGD assumption (cell B5 in Loan Risk sheet). Consider reducing if collateral exists

**Issue**: Charts not updating
**Solution**: Right-click chart → Select Data → Verify ranges are correct

**Issue**: Formulas showing as text
**Solution**: Check that cells are formatted as "General" not "Text"
